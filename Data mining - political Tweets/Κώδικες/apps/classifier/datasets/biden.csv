JoeBiden,"Now he’s switched to falsely telling us that he’s taking action that he has not taken, and promising results that he’s not delivering. People are scared. They're frightened. And their president is just exacerbating their concerns.",2020-03-21

JoeBiden,The poor are getting poorer and the bottom is falling out of the middle class. Income inequality is on the rise — made worse by the Trump tax cut that was a giant give-away to the super-wealthy.,2019-06-28
JoeBiden,"We have to rebuild the backbone of this nation – the middle class. And this time make sure everyone comes along, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or disability.",2019-06-28
JoeBiden,"Every day we are being reminded what this election is about. Who we are. What we stand for. What we believe. I am running to offer our country a different path – not back to a past that never was, but to a future that fulfills our true potential as a country.",2019-06-28
JoeBiden,We know in our bones this election is different. We have a president who promotes hate and division. Encourages white supremacists. Embraces dictators. And damages our alliances internationally. Our politics traffics in division. And our president is the divider in chief.,2019-06-28
JoeBiden,"In an hour, I’ll take the stage for the first Democratic debate to discuss my vision for the country. As I’ve said from day one, I’m running for president for three reasons: to restore the soul of this nation, rebuild its backbone — the middle class, and unify all Americans.",2019-06-28
JoeBiden,"From day one, we've refused to take money from any corporate PACs or lobbyists. Today, I’m building on that base by signing @NoFossilMoney’s pledge to reject support from the PACs, lobbyists, or executives of fossil fuel companies. I work for you — not any industry.",2019-06-27
JoeBiden,"In America, every worker deserves fair treatment, safe workplaces, and the right to join a union. Period. I’m proud to stand in solidarity with airport workers across the country as they strike for their right to organize. #RespectUSworkers",2019-06-27
JoeBiden,"Today’s decision from the court hopefully means there will not be a question on the 2020 Census, but we have much more work to do to ensure all voices are heard in our democracy.",2019-06-27
JoeBiden,"Make no mistake, the Trump Administration added a citizenship question to the Census to deliberately cut out the voices of immigrants and communities of color. It’s wrong and goes against our core values as a nation.",2019-06-27
JoeBiden,Today the Supreme Court refused to stop politicians rigging our democracy by writing election rules for their own benefit. It couldn’t have happened without Justices put there by Donald Trump and Republicans — another reason why Democrats must take back the White House in 2020.,2019-06-27
JoeBiden,"I was proud to sign @IndivisibleTeam’s pledge. Our large and diverse set of qualified Democratic candidates is evidence of our strength as a party, and I am committed to supporting whomever becomes the nominee. The most important thing is to beat Donald Trump. Period.",2019-06-27
JoeBiden,"All marriages, at their root, are about love. And four years ago, the Supreme Court affirmed that simple proposition in Obergefell v. Hodges. Thank you to the generations of LGBTQ trailblazers who refused to bend before the voices of intolerance. Your courage changed the world.",2019-06-26
JoeBiden,This image is gut-wrenching. The cruelty we're seeing at our border is unconscionable. History will judge how we respond to the Trump Administration’s treatment of immigrant families & children—we can’t be silent. This isn't who we are. This is not America.,2019-06-26
JoeBiden,"One year ago, the Supreme Court upheld Trump's Muslim ban—one of this administration's most egregious attacks on our core values. Wielding the politics of fear and intolerance by slandering entire religious communities as complicit in terrorism is wrong, and it’s not who we are.",2019-06-26
JoeBiden,"DREAMers are Americans, and Congress needs to make it official. The millions of DREAMers and undocumented individuals in the United States can only be brought out of the shadows through fair treatment, not ugly threats.",2019-06-26

JoeBiden,"Add your name to call on Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act and make every American's voice equal, once and for all. #RestoreTheVote",2019-06-25
JoeBiden,"Civil rights was one of the things that got me engaged in politics. Six years after Shelby County v. Holder, voting rights are under attack across the country. And that’s one of the reasons I’m running for president today. We must renew our efforts to protect the right to vote.",2019-06-25
JoeBiden,"We must secure our borders, but “build the wall” is a slogan divorced from reality. We need to focus on improving screening procedures at our legal ports of entry & making smart investments in border technology. These policies will do more for our security than a wall ever could.",2019-06-25
JoeBiden,.@GabbyGiffords’ dedication to making our communities safer continues to be an inspiration. I join her in urging the Senate to vote on #BackgroundChecksNow. We must take on the @NRA and end the epidemic of gun violence in our country.,2019-06-24
JoeBiden,"Thank you for a great weekend, South Carolina!",2019-06-24
JoeBiden,"Trump sólo está interesado en políticas que atacan la dignidad de la comunidad Latina y asustan a los votantes para que se presenten en las urnas el día de las elecciones, sin interés por abordar los desafíos reales que enfrenta nuestro hemisferio.",2019-06-24
JoeBiden,"It’s clear Trump is only interested in using his policies to assault the dignity of the Hispanic community and scare voters to turn out on Election Day, while not addressing the real challenges facing our hemisphere. Read my full op-ed here:",2019-06-24
JoeBiden,We’re bringing together supporters across the country for the first Democratic debate! Head to http://JoeBiden.com/Events to RSVP to a watch party in your community.,2019-06-23
JoeBiden,"The Trump Administration is arguing in the 9th Circuit that migrant children held in detention centers without soap, toothbrushes or beds are in conditions that are “safe and sanitary”. It’s an all-out assault on human dignity and our standards as a nation. We must do better.",2019-06-23
JoeBiden,"Trump’s erratic, impulsive actions are the last thing we need as Commander-in-Chief. No president should order a military strike without fully understanding the consequences. We don’t need another war in the Middle East, but Trump’s actions toward Iran only make that more likely.",2019-06-23
JoeBiden,"Planned Parenthood helps women and individuals get the health care they need — especially preventive services like cancer screenings, mammograms, checkups, and contraception. Thank you to @PPact for having me at today’s #WeDecide Forum to discuss these important issues.",2019-06-22
JoeBiden,"I support @PPact because women and transgender individuals' health care is essential. Historically, women — and particularly women of color — have been put in a position where they cannot access health care, in a more extreme way more than any other part of the population.",2019-06-22
JoeBiden,It’s always great to be back at the #ClyburnFishFry. Thank you to @ClyburnSC06 and everyone who came out for a great night!,2019-06-22
JoeBiden,"President Trump continues to deny the scientific evidence in front of his own eyes and attack the progress we’ve made on climate change. It’s unacceptable. In a Biden Administration, we’ll turbocharge our efforts to achieve a 100% clean energy economy.",2019-06-21
JoeBiden,"Climate change poses an existential threat to our communities, economy, national security, and environment. Our plan for a Clean Energy Revolution & Environmental Justice will address the climate emergency & protect our communities for generations to come.",2019-06-20
JoeBiden,"We have to take on the epidemic of violence against the transgender community — especially trans women of color. Ten trans women have been killed violently in 2019 so far. We must stand up, speak out, and put an end to this hate.",2019-06-20
JoeBiden,This month marks 50 years since a movement was born on Christopher Street — a movement that has delivered so much acceptance & hope & pride for the LGBTQ community. I stopped by @TheStonewallNYC to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the uprising that changed our world forever.,2019-06-20
JoeBiden,"What we need is presidential leadership that will take strategic action to counter the Iranian threat, restore America's standing in the world, recognize the value of principled diplomacy, and strengthen our nation and our security by working strategically with our allies.",2019-06-20
JoeBiden,Make no mistake: Iran continues to be a bad actor that abuses human rights and supports terrorist activities throughout the region.,2019-06-20
JoeBiden,"It’s sadly ironic that the State Department is now calling on Iran to abide by the very deal the Trump Administration abandoned. By walking away from diplomacy, Trump has made military conflict more likely. Another war in the Middle East is the last thing we need.",2019-06-20
JoeBiden,"But they’ve only gotten more aggressive. Trump also promised that walking away would somehow lead to a better deal – instead, the predictable has happened: Iran is building back up its nuclear capability.",2019-06-20
JoeBiden,He unilaterally withdrew from the hard-won nuclear agreement that the Obama-Biden Administration negotiated to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Trump promised that abandoning the deal and imposing sanctions would stop Iran’s aggression in the region.,2019-06-20
JoeBiden,President Trump's Iran strategy is a self-inflicted disaster. Two of America's vital interests in the Middle East are preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and securing a stable energy supply through the Strait of Hormuz. Trump is failing on both counts.,2019-06-20
JoeBiden,"As we recognize Juneteenth and the progress we’ve made since slavery, we must also double down on our efforts to root out systemic racism. We have to make sure we’re working to move closer to that more perfect union, to the idea of America that has inspired so many generations.",2019-06-19
JoeBiden,"America was founded on the ideals of equality, equity, & fairness—but has failed to live up to that promise for all people. In 2019, the unemployment rate for black people is almost twice that of white people. Children born poor are twice as likely to stay poor if they’re black.",2019-06-19
JoeBiden,"Trump’s policies appear intentionally designed to aggravate the situation to scare Americans into re-electing him. Cutting off aid to Central America will increase migration to our Southern border, not reduce it.",2019-06-19
JoeBiden,President Trump threatening the mass deportation of immigrants is cruel and un-American. We can fix our broken immigration system and enforce our laws without tossing aside our values.,2019-06-19
JoeBiden,"This is truly the most important election of our lifetime. If we want to defeat Donald Trump, it’s going to take everyone stepping up, speaking out, and taking action. Join our team today and let’s get to work:",2019-06-19
JoeBiden,"Trump’s response to Charlottesville two years ago was abhorrent, but it’s not just that. It’s happening every day. Separating children from their parents at the border. Attacking women's rights. Rolling back LGBTQ protections. We’re better than this.",2019-06-19
JoeBiden,"Trump continues to undermine our standing in the world. Our core values of inclusivity, diversity, respect for the rule of law, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion are under attack here at home and abroad.",2019-06-19
JoeBiden,"Just look at his tax plan. As president, Biden will reverse Trump’s tax cuts for the super wealthy. It’s time we reward work, not just wealth.",2019-06-19
JoeBiden,"Let’s be clear: President Trump inherited a growing economy from the Obama-Biden administration. And now, he’s in the process of squandering it.",2019-06-19
JoeBiden,"Hey there - @TeamJoe here. President Trump dismisses everything he doesn’t want to hear as “FAKE NEWS” -- so as he announces his re-election, we want to make sure you have the real facts on his record:",2019-06-19
JoeBiden,"For all the hard-won progress, for as much as we can celebrate how much better things have gotten — this fight is not over. We have to come together to stand up to abuses of power, ensure that everyone is treated with dignity, and fight for full equality.",2019-06-18

JoeBiden,"Under President Trump’s policies, a four-month-old was separated from his family at the border. It’s unconscionable and fundamentally at odds with everything our nation stands for. America is better than this.",2019-06-18
JoeBiden,"Happy anniversary to the love of my life and the life of my love, @DrBiden. I’m forever grateful you agreed to spend the rest of your life with me. I love you, Jilly!",2019-06-17

JoeBiden,"Lastly, I discussed how my health care plan will include access to a Medicare-like public option for anyone who wants it.",2019-06-17
JoeBiden,"I declared that we have to do everything we can to protect the most sacred, fundamental right we have: the right to vote.",2019-06-17
JoeBiden,"I discussed how in a Biden Administration, we’ll support teachers and ensure every kid has access to a quality education. Because in America, no child’s future should be determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability.",2019-06-17
JoeBiden,"I talked about how the greatest sin is the abuse of power — whether economic, or physical, or social. And, it’s our duty to fight back against those who would abuse it. That starts with access to a real living wage — a $15 minimum wage.",2019-06-17
JoeBiden,"I was honored to join @UniteThePoor, @RevDrBarber, and @liztheo at today’s #PPCMoralCongress Presidential Forum.",2019-06-17
JoeBiden,"Today, I took @EricHolder's @demredistrict pledge to support #FairMaps. For too long, gerrymandering has allowed politicians to pick who they represent. That’s wrong. I’m committed to fair redistricting where elected officials are accountable to those they represent.",2019-06-17
JoeBiden,"Four years ago, a white supremacist walked into ""Mother Emanuel"" and gunned down nine brave souls, including my friend Clementa Pinckney. It's not enough to remember them. We have to fight for them. We are in a battle for the soul of this nation.",2019-06-17
JoeBiden,"7 years ago, @BarackObama and I offered security to DREAMers, young people brought here as kids who only know America as home. Trump is trying to break our country's promise to them &amp; continues to threaten their status. DREAMers are Americans. It’s time we kept our word to them.",2019-06-16
JoeBiden,"Good luck to the @USWNT as they take on Chile! As we cheer them on in the World Cup, we must support their fight off the field for equal pay. In 2019, it’s past time we close the pay gap and ensure women get paid as much as men. #OneNationOneTeam",2019-06-16
JoeBiden,"As my father believed, there’s no higher calling for a woman or a man than to be a good mother or a good father. Happy Father’s Day to all the dads out there who work every day to help raise their children—and all our children—to be honorable, generous, kind young men and women.",2019-06-16
JoeBiden,"This country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers, CEOs, or hedge fund managers. It was built by the American middle class. It’s time we recognize that. We’ve got to build an economy and a tax code that rewards work, not just wealth.",2019-06-15
JoeBiden,"In America, no child’s future should be determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability. In a Biden Administration, we’ll invest in our students, schools, and educators to ensure every kid gets a fair shot. Read the plan here: http://JoeBiden.com/Education",2019-06-15
JoeBiden,"The extraordinary bravery shown by hundreds of thousands in Hong Kong, marching for the civil liberties & autonomy promised by China is inspiring. And the world is watching. All of us must stand in support of democratic principles and freedom.",2019-06-14
JoeBiden,This is simple. No candidate running for office should help foreign governments undermine our democracy. That includes the sitting President of the United States. Our elections should be decided by the American people — not Vladimir Putin.,2019-06-14
JoeBiden,Donald Trump doesn’t think it matters if candidates accept damaging intel on their opponent from a foreign government. He’s dead wrong. That’s why I’m signing the Pledge for Election Integrity. I refuse to help those who seek to undermine our democracy. http://go.joebiden.com/election-pledge,2019-06-14
JoeBiden,Every worker in this country deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages and benefits — and the right to collectively bargain. I’m proud to stand with Detroit security officers today as they fight for a $15 minimum wage and union rights. #OneDetroit,2019-06-14

JoeBiden,"I have nothing against Amazon, but no company pulling in billions of dollars of profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers. We need to reward work, not just wealth.",2019-06-13
JoeBiden,President Trump is once again welcoming foreign interference in our elections. This isn’t about politics. It is a threat to our national security. An American President should not seek their aid and abet those who seek to undermine democracy.,2019-06-13
JoeBiden,We had a great day in Iowa talking about how we rebuild the backbone of our country — the middle class. Thank you to everyone who came out to join us!,2019-06-12
JoeBiden,"Today in 1967, the Supreme Court struck down interracial marriage bans in Loving v. Virginia—a decision that inched us closer to our founding ideals of equality, equity, & fairness. The decision reminds us progress doesn’t happen on its own—every generation has to fight for it.",2019-06-12

JoeBiden,We can’t afford four more years of an administration that gambles with the livelihoods of American families. Working families deserve a president who is fighting for them. #TeamJoe,2019-06-11
JoeBiden,Trump doesn’t get the basics. He thinks his tariffs are being paid by China. Any freshman econ student could tell you that the American people are paying his tariffs. The cashiers at Target see what’s going on – they know more about economics than Trump. #TeamJoe,2019-06-11
JoeBiden,"He thinks he’s being tough. Well, it’s easy to be tough when someone else is feeling the pain. How many farmers across Iowa and across this nation are facing the prospect of losing their business, of losing their farm because of Trump’s tariffs? #TeamJoe",2019-06-11
JoeBiden,Tune in here:,2019-06-11

JoeBiden,"I know how to beat the NRA because I’ve done it before - twice. I shepherded through the passage of the Brady background check bill in 1993, and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in 1994. As president, I will defeat the NRA again.",2019-06-07
JoeBiden,We can’t let a special interest group dictate the safety of the rest of the country. That’s why defeating the NRA is a key element of our education policy we introduced last week.,2019-06-07

JoeBiden,There are actions that Congress can take right now if they were to listen to the majority of the American people who want to see our government take action to stop gun violence.,2019-06-07
JoeBiden,We don't need to convince the American public that common-sense measures to reduce gun violence are a good idea. 2 in 3 people believe that we need stricter gun laws.,2019-06-07
JoeBiden,This is politics at its worst. We should all feel safe to walk the streets of our own cities and towns. Our workers should feel safe at work. Our students should always feel safe at school.,2019-06-07
JoeBiden,We need action. But the NRA and gun manufacturers have such a firm grip on Republicans in Congress that they refuse to consider common-sense gun reforms.,2019-06-07

JoeBiden,"Women’s rights and health care are under assault in a way that seeks to roll back every step of progress we’ve made over the last 50 years.

It can’t be ignored. Human rights must be at the core—not periphery—of our engagement in the world.",2019-06-04
JoeBiden,Today is the anniversary of China's brutal crackdown in Tiananmen Square. Authorities tried to stop peaceful calls for political change with rifles & tanks.
