"That’s not the point. That would be like saying sanders has to get 1200 yards rushing because he’s a RUNNING back, but we all love his production in the receiving game as well. When a defense has to prepare from the run or pass from all angles it’s dangerous",2020-04-24
Bernie Sanders has been in politics for decades. He know all of these things of which you speak. He and the elites who were in charge of his campaign staff know all of those things. You were duped. You were used. It's not a mistake that Bernie doesn't challenge the primary fraud,2020-04-24
I’m thinking that perhaps they had similar type grades on Ruggs/Lamb/Jeudy and Aiyuk and the thought of being able to replace both Buck And Sanders with younger controlled guys enticed them. Moving from 13 allowed them to get up to 25 to get him. I don’t believe he’s there at 31,2020-04-24
